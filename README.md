# Packer Build: Raspbian OS

Build a custom Raspbian OS image using Docker, Packer, and [packer-builder-arm](https://github.com/mkaczanowski/packer-builder-arm).

Since enabling SSH on the raspbian requires creating the `/boot/ssh` file, I
have automated doing this with packer. Additional customizations are possible
and I suggest you fork this repo and make your own changes.

## Requirements

- docker
- docker-compose

## Usage

Checkout `packer-builder-arm` submodule.

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Build `raspberry-pi.img`

```sh
make build
```

The `raspberry-pi.img` artifact can be burned to an SD card. I
use [etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher) for burning.

## Bonus: Configuration Management with Ansible

Can be paired with https://github.com/jason-riddle/ansible-hashistack-bramble
for managing multiple Raspberry Pis.
